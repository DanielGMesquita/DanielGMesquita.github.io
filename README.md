### Configuring Chirpy

1. **Update Theme Settings**

    The Chirpy theme settings can be customized through the _config.yml file. This includes site title, description, logo, and other theme-specific settings. Refer to the Chirpy [documentation](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/) for detailed instructions on theme configuration.
